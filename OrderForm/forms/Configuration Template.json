	Constraints applicable to all fields: 
			"@DEP_CONDITION@" = "CAT01,CAT02/DISC:-1000" - Conditions for the field to be enabled
				-	"CAT01,CAT02" - Names separated by comma, ALL needs to have valid non-empty input
				-	"CAT01/CAT02" - Names separated by slash, ANY of the fields must have a valid input
							Slash and comma can be combined, but slash is checked after comma,
							 so "CAT01/CAT03,CAT02" means that "CAT02" must allways valid, and either "CAT01" and/or "CAT03" must be
							 valid
				-	"@INVOICE_CURRENCY@:SEK" - Name and value separated by colon, field must have that specific value
							Colon can be added after any field name so "@INVOICE_PERIOD@:Monthly,@INVOICE_CURRENCY@:SEK"
							 means that period has to be Monthly AND currency has to be SEK
							Colon is checked last so "@INVOICE_CURRENCY@:SEK/EUR" would not work, EUR would be interpreted
							 as an AccessName.
			"@DEP_VALID@" = "CAT01,CAT02" - Fields REQUIRED to have non-empty valid input, no modifiers (/:) here yet.
																	This requirement is shown at the referenced field
		
		OBS!: "@TRUE_STRING@" and "@FALSE_STRING@" must be written just so (capitalized and in citation) when used in Constraints
					since they are parsed as strings.
					But as true and false when set to values.
	

	Field types
		Number = 0
		Price = 1
		Text = 2
		Multiline = 3
		Boolean = 4
		Date = 5
		Duration = 6
		Phone = 7
		Email = 8
		Address = 9
		Url = 10
		Choice = 11
		Person = 12
		Product = 13
		Info = 14
		Sum = 15

		
		Number = 0
			Quantity, always positive, no decimals.


		Price = 1
			Currency, currently no decimal places. 
			Constraints:
				-	"@INVOICE_CURRENCY@" = "True"/"False"/"{AccessName}" (False)
				-	"Negative" = "True"/"False" (False) - Sets the field to only hold negative values (for discount fields)
				-	"@PRODUCT_GROUP@" = "Licenses" - groups total costs of products together in summary


		Text = 2,
			Single line arbitrary text, anything goes.


		Multiline = 3,
			Resizable field of arbitrary text, anything goes.


		Boolean = 4,
			Checkbox, always has a value, unchecked = false, checked = true.


		Date = 5,
			Single date selector.
			Constraints:
				-	"Span" = "355"/"?355" - Sets the time in days between this and the other Date field. Setting this 
																	value also Requires a DEP_CONDITION constraint referencing another Date field
							'?' - If present it is not enforced, only added as initial value


		Duration = 6,
			Double date selector, defining a period of time.
			Constraints:
				-	"Span" = "355"/"?355" - Sets the time in days between the start and end date.
							'?' - If present it is not enforced, only added as initial value


		Phone = 7,
			Phone number formatted text string, prevents any input that is not a valid phone number.


		Email = 8,
			Email address formatted text string, prevents any input that is not a valid email address.


		Address = 9,
			A composite field which combines a few fields into a single address value, a drop-down list 
			to select country/region and three text fields for street, city and postal code respectively.

			Constraints:
				-	"@ORDER_COUNTRY@" = "True"/"False"/"This" (False) - Source of address country
							"True" - Use the orders globally set country, i.e the customers country of operation
							"False" - (default) Use a specific country for this field only
							"@THIS_STRING@" - Set this field to be the source of said global country
				-	"FullAddress" = "True"/"False" (True) - Whether field is a complete street address, or only a country


		Url = 10,
			Internet URL formatted text string, prevents any input that is not a valid URL

	
		Choice = 11,
			An element with a number of choices:
				-	Radio buttons for single selection from less than 5 choices,
				-	Checkboxes for multiple selection from less than 5 choices,
				-	Dropdown list for single or multiple selections from 5 or more choices
		
			Constraints:
				-	"Choices" = "One,Two,Three"/"DB:Table" - Choices separated by comma, or a collection with source 
																								 and name separated by colon "SOURCE:SetName"
							"EXL:*" for tables stored in the Excel file
				-	"Multiple" = "#" (1) - Max number of choices 1+
				-	"@DEFAULT@" = "0,4,5" - Choice number(s) selected by default

	
		Person = 12,
			A composite field which combines up to 7 fields into one value describing a person.
			Constraints:
				-	"RequiredFlags" = "yyyyyyyy"/"nnnnnnnn" : Which personal fields are required
							index (position in text), (default), Value
							i = 0 (y) : First name
							i = 1 (y) : Last name
							i = 2 (n) : Birthdate
							i = 3 (y) : Phone number
							i = 4 (y) : Email address
							i = 5 (n) : Work address
							i = 6 (n) : Home address
							i =  () :
	

		Product = 13,
			A composite field listing products in the specified category loaded from the product list.
			Constraints:
				-	"Category" = "CAT01" - Restrict which product category to display
				-	"@PRODUCT_GROUP@" = "Licenses" - Groups total costs of products together in summary


		Info = 14,
			A field only for displaying information, some formatting and controlling validation for groups of fields.
			If an info field is added to a section, all fields between that and the next Info field are included in the group.
			Inserting an empty Info field (nothing but the FieldType value set) ends any previous group, but does not create its own.
			Values in config:
					DisplayName - A subheading for the set
					Required - Sets all group fields to be required
					Constraints - Sets condition for entire group ( better performance than if all fields share a condition and each one 
												checks it individually )
			Constraints:
					"@DEP_CONDITION@" - conditions for when the group will be enabled
					"@DEP_VALID@" - ( Not implemented )


		Sum = 15,
			A currency sum field only for displaying the periodic subtotal of referred fields
			Constraints:
					"@DEP_CONDITION@" = "CAT01/CAT02/..." - Displays the sum of the numeric values of all valid fields, 
																							AccessNames separated by slash
